# OpenGLRasterizer
 A rasterizer written in OpenGL based on the tutorials from https://learnopengl.com/
 
 The code in this repo contains a lot of notes, generally about what each line is doing. However, my overarching, more theoretical notes from these tutorials can be found in the [ReadingNotes](https://github.com/Chrezon/ReadingNotes) repo
